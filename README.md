The example above highlights the ease of linking data together to provide value to an event owner. Obviously for a production ready dashboard, a login experience is required. We focused on the backend logic rather than the frontend authentication flow.

If you are interested in setting up a full dashboard experience, a tutorial is in the works. Follow me on twitter for updates, (@isaacwgarcia)[https://twitter.com/isaacwgarcia].
